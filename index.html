		<h3>Trekks</h3>
	</div>
	<div id="TreksInhalt">
		<p>
		<h4>General advice</h4>
			If you don't have enough time for a certain trekk, you can most likely shorten it. You can take a bus/jeep in some places or you make long days by doing two episodes in one.
			But remember don't fuck with altitude acclimatization - you need to stick to the recommended stages above 3000 m. 
		</p>
		
		<p>
		<h4>Annapurna Circuit</h4>
			It is a long trek with about 18 to 21 days but it offers a lot of great mountain views including different climate zones. You can shorten the trek by 
			taking a bus or being fast. Very often you can take side trips which are less crowded and offer a more traditional experience.
			You start in the subtropical town Besisahar and move up north. The first day is a little bit ruined by a dam constructions side. But it just gets better and better. The following Manang valley
			is a magical place and slowly takes you to higher mountain ranges. And crossing the Thorong La pass (5416 m) really feels like an achievement. After that you come to the Gali Gandaki,
			which is an arid area and the deepest valley of the earth. You can expect strong winds howling between the Annapurnas and Dhaulagiris.
		</p>
		
		<p>
		<h4>Annapurna Base Camp</h4>
			The Annapurna Base Camp trek is a shot trekk (~ 7 days). It can be very crowded and you met a lot of other trekkers.
			Most of them come frome Pokhara and it is their only trek in Nepal. Reaching the Annapurna Base Camp doesn't really feels like an achievement
			simply because it is too easy. You follow one path and a valley. However you get great views of the Annapurnas and it is a good option if you don't
			have the time for long trek like the Annapurna Circuit.
		</p>
			
		<p>
		<h4>Khopra Danda/Ridge</h4>
			It is a short trek if you are already in Ghorepani (2-3 days). But it is a great trek because you will only meet a few other tourists.
			In general it feels better to spend money on a smaller trek. The Khopra Danda lodge rewards you with stunning views of Dhaulagiri I and Annapurna South.
		</p>
		
		<p>
		<h4> Mardi Himal</h4>
			It is a short trekk with 3-4 days. When I went for this trek I didn't know what to expect. My map of the Annapurna region wasn't even showing any lodges. 
			So I was very surprised to see lodges on the entire trek. The trek itself is not overpopulated and you can get good views. 
			You will see a lot of rhododendron forests on the way and follow a ridge.

		<h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
	</div>
	<div id="FAQinhalt">
	
	<h3>How do I get to the Annapurna region ?</h3>
	<p>
		If you want to go right for the Annapurna Circuit, you can take a daily bus from Kathmandu to Besisahar for 450 Rs (2016).
		The bus to Besisahar is a little bit hard to find in the chaos of the Gongabu bus park.
		My bus took off a little bit north of the Gongabu bus park - next to the ring road.	I had a great taxi driver who helped me find the correct bus. 
		If your taxi driver doesn't know the bus you better ask around at the Gongabu bus station. It takes 6-8 hours to get to Besisahar with 1-2 stopps where you can go
		to the toilet or eat Dal Bhat :).		
	</p>
	
	<h3>How much money do I need ?</h3>
	<p>
		Nepal is a poor and cheap country. Expect to spend about 15€ - 20€ per day for accommodation and food while trekking.
		The accommodation in lodges is mostly cheap with 5€ or less. Sometimes you can even bargain so that you get free accomodation if you have lunch, dinner and breakfast in the lodge.
		Dal Bhat on the trek costs somewhere between 200 - 700 Rs (2 - 6€). The general roule is - the higher or more remote you go, the more expensive does food become. Drinking a beer on the trekk will add 2-4 € to your bill.
		If you want to drink something cheaper you can chose the local Raksi, which tastes like something between sake and rice wine.
		Keep in mind that you can't rely on ATMs because there are simply none on the trekks. Well there is one in Jomson but it is kind of a gamble, because it might be empty or broken.
		So take enough money with you :)
	</p>
	
	<h3>Do I need a guide/porter/porterguide ? </h3>
	<p>
		This depends on your personal circumstances. I did the Annapurna Circuit, Annpurna Base Camp, Mardihimal, Khopra Danda trek without a guide or porter.
		It is really hard to get lost because most of the time you follow a valley and you see other trekkers and locals.
		In most cases the trekk is well marked and easy to find. If you are in doubt you can ask the locals and they are always willing to help.
		Keep in mind that a porter from a subtropical village might not have appropriate clothes for the mountains.
		I saw a "guide" running around in the snow and ice of the Annapurna Base Camp with jogging shoes...
		You definitely don't need a guide for the Annapurna Base Camp. You simply have to follow a path in a narrow valley. Nevertheless most people take a guide...
		You can take a guide or porter if you want to help by spending some money, but you don't need them to find the way. There are other and more remote trekks
		where a guide or porter is required by law. You are better off with saving the money for porters/guides on such a trekk. 
		<br></br>				
	</p>
	
	<h3>What kind of clothings do I need ?</h3>
	<p>
		The Annapurna Circuit crosses a lot of climate zones.
		You need to be prepaired for the hot subtropical climate with 30 &deg   C in Besi Sahar and for the alpine climate with potentially life threatening temperatures.		
		So you better bring a decent pair of hiking boots and good winter jacket as well as shorts and t-shirts. Always keep in mind that 43 people died at the Thorong La pass during a blizzard in October 2014.
	</p>
	
	<h3>Altitude sickness/acute mountain sickness(AMS)</h3>
	<p>
		There is a daily talk in Manang by a western doctor. You will get all the informations about AMS and you can test your blood oxygen saturation for a small donation.
		We were told that half the trekkers experience mild ams symptoms (headache,...) when crossig the Thorong La pass.
